## Approach
{:#approach}

- Cite linktraversalcaching
- We extended cMatch to also work with property paths (define formally?), and extended zero-knowledge planner.
- LDP-based actors
- Type index actor
- Make use of subweb specification formalization to capture LDP and type idx, and make sure to also include formal basis of link traversal
