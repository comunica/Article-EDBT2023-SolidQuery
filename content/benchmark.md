## Benchmark
{:#benchmark}

Write me.
Goal: Simulate and analyze structural properies of solid ecosystem.
Derive motivation from benchmark from ldbc snb paper
{:.todo}

Benchmark aspects:
- Generator: SNB+fragmenter: schema and generator for creating datasets at different scales
- 27 query templates covering different chokepoints (19 from SNB interactive and 8 new)
- Tools to execute experiment and measurement of metrics

[LDBC SNB interactive](cite:cites ldbc_snb_interactive, ldbc_snb_details)
