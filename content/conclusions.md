## Conclusions
{:#conclusions}

- Our results show that link traversal behaves quite different under these assumptions
- Say termination and completeness problems are solved!(?)
- The ability to close the world around solid pods create query opt opoortunities
- Best termination condition is a LIMIT in the query? (but incompat with ORDER BY...)
- Mention need for new datastructures (see ideas note)
- Need for adaptive query planning!
